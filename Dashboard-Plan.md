# Week 2 - Dashboard Template

Agreed to a template for the dashboard that would show the comparison of two brands of fake meat products, selected from the drop down menu.  The 2 slide dashboard shall contain the following graphics:

First a comparison of the word frequence used to describe reviews that are predicted to be positive, and those that are negative:

then a slide showing how the sentiment for the brand changes with time by depicting the number of positive reviews (upward bar) and negative reviews (downward bar)

# Week 3  & 4 - Dashboard Template

Will use scraping data from 5 different brands to generate figures for dashboard - scrapping data from an average of 3 products per brand:

Decided to create three template visualizations: 
1. Word cloud to show 10 most frequent used words in negative and positive reviews per brand:

    ![](/Resources/Quorn-pos-neg.PNG)

    ![](/Resources/Tofurky-pos-neg.PNG)


2. Table to show frequency with which top 10 words appeared in all product negative and positve reviews per brand.

3. Plot of average price and average rating evolution over time (per year) - Tiffany designed this:

    ![](/Resources/Review-price-evolution.PNG)

Created word cloud by taking text of reviews in csv format (obtained from Tiffany) - ~1000 total reviews (~200 per) - note that there were 834 positive reviews and only 173 negative reviews - and converting text to columns.  

Then filtered out CSV file to only contain 1) reviews with ratings of 1 or 2 (negative reviews) and 2) reviews with ratings of 4 or 5 (positive reviews) to create two new CSV files.

     ![](r1-2-scraped_reviews-text-to-columns.csv)

     ![](r4-5-scraped_reviews-text-to-columns.csv)

Next each csv file was saved as unicode text and imported as a data source into tableau.  

All figures were created in tableau.

Stop words were filtered out using a list of words taken from: http://xpo6.com/list-of-english-stop-words/

Then a filter was applied to only show the top 10 most frequent words for each brand.
