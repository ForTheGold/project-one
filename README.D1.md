## Topic

The topic of our project involves artificial meat review predictions.  

## The Why

We selected this topic because the artificial meat industry is becoming increasingly popular as of late.  We find it the industry very interesting and want to understand how consumer experience and resulting reviews can predict ratings. After pulling and cleaning our data set from Amazon, we are going to use the Natural Language Processing machine learning model to train a sentiment classifier. During the cleaning process, both five and one star reviews will be maintained, while two, three and four star ratings will be removed.  Next, we will pull reviews without ratings and direct the machine to predict the ratings based on the analysis of the reviews.  

## Source Data

Our data set was pulled from the Amazon Grocery and Gourmet Food section (http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html).  We are currently working through the process of determining the site from which we will pull the reviews without ratings.  

## Goals

In this project we will use a Natural Language Processing machine learning model to train a sentiment classifier on an Amazon dataset of Grocery and Gourmet Food reviews (https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) containing over 1 million reviews.  

The goal of this classifier is to predict user sentiment (positive or negative) for fake meat products.  Upon having ratings predicted based on the reviews through NLP, We believe this analysis will help store owners identify which fake meat brands to sell. Having access to a model to predict ratings will allow the stakeholder to understand how reviews affect ratings and, in turn, impact future sales of fake meat products.

### Week 2 - Update on Progress
We continued to clean and organize the data set to finalize the machine learning process and database.  We also started working on the dashboards and website we plan to create. Using Tableau, graphs will display static information regarding the correlation between months/years and ratings. We also are creating an interactive site that will allow a user to input review words, which will populate the predicted positive or negative rating.  This site will be available through Heroku.  Finally, work has begun on the slide deck for the final presentation.

## Dashboard
We have identified possible graphs to reflect our information, such as a line graph and/or a heat map. This is still a work in progress; we plan to use Tableau.

## Presentation
A copy of the draft slides has been uploaded to our repository.

### Progress
Our team meets at least three times per week and touches base regularly. We have found a productive cadence around roles and responsibilities and are continuing to make progress toward the final product.
