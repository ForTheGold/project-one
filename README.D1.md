# Artificial Meat Review Predictions - Deliverable One & Two

This is a group project by Tamar Brand-Perez, Tiffany Price, Ben Tubbs, and Jose Santos.
## Topic
The topic of our project involves artificial meat review predictions.  

## The Why
We selected this topic because the artificial meat industry is becoming increasingly popular as of late.  We find it the industry very interesting and want to understand how consumer experience and resulting reviews can predict ratings. After pulling and cleaning our data set from Amazon, we are going to use the Natural Language Processing machine learning model to train a sentiment classifier. During the cleaning process, both five and one star reviews will be maintained, while two, three and four star ratings will be removed.  Next, we will pull reviews without ratings and direct the machine to predict the ratings based on the analysis of the reviews.  

## Source Data
Our data set was pulled from the Amazon Grocery and Gourmet Food section (http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html).  We are currently working through the process of determining the site from which we will pull the reviews without ratings.  

## Goals
We would like to have a successful model that predicts ratings based upon the analyzed reviews. Upon having ratings predicted based on the reviews through NLP, we believe this analysis will help artificial meat producers understand how reviews will impact ratings and have a potential impact on thier popularity and future sales.

## Progress
Our team meets at least three times per week and touches base regularly. We have found a productive cadence around roles and responsibilties and are continuing to make progress toward the final product.
