Artificial Meat Review Predictions

This is a group project by Tamar Brand-Perez, Tiffany Price, Ben Tubbs, and Jose Santos.

The topic of our project involves artificial meat review predictions.  We selected this topic because the artificial meat industry is becoming increasingly popular as of late. After pulling and cleaning our data set from Amazon, we are going to use the Natural Language Processing machine learning model to train a sentiment classifier. Next, we will pull reviews without ratings and diret the machine to predict the ratings based on the analysis of the reviews.  We believe this analysis will help artificial meat producers understand how the reviews will impact future sales to new customers.
