# Project One

## Overview of the Project
This is a group project by Tamar Brand-Perez, Tiffany Price, Ben Tubbs, and Jose Santos.  

### Purpose

In this project we will use a Natural Language Processing machine learning model to train a sentiment classifier on an Amazon dataset of Grocery and Gourmet Food reviews (https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) containing over 1 million reviews.  

The goal of this classifier is to predict user sentiment (positive or negative) for fake meat products.
