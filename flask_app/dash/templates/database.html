					Data Source:<br><br>
					Amazon product data was taken with permission from professor Julian McAuley's website from the
					Computer Science Department at UCSD. The dataset includes product reviews and metadata from Amazon,
					of approximately 5 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014.
					<br><br>The products reviewed in this dataset were all types of groceries.

					<br><br>A second source of the data was of reviews scraped from Amazon website. Fake meat products from 5
					brands were scraped. The brands are:
					Beyond Meat, Boca, Tofurky, Quorn and Gardein.
					<br><br>
					Finally, reviews of fake meat on Reddit were scraped. 
					<br><br>
					The reviews on Amazon have star ratings which allows us to compare the machine learning algorythm predictions to the number of stars a review had. For example, the review on Amazon got a 5 star rating and the machine learning predicted it is a positive review. This would be an accurate prediction. 
					Then, once the algorythm was trained, we used it to predict whether a rating is positive or negative for reviews from Reddit. The reviews on Reddit do not have a star rating but since we know that the algorythm is correct approximately 80% of the time, there is a relatively high degree of confidence in the predictions given by the algorythm and this can be used to categorize the reviews that do not have the star rating.

						Database Tables:
						<br><br>
						The database is organized into 3 tables: brand table, product table and review table. The data for the review table comes from the scraping as well as the groceries dataset from UCSD. The data for the brand and product tables comes from scraping of fake meat products on Amazon and Reddit. 
						Each brand has several products so the connection between the tables is a one to many connection on the index_brand to index_brand-product. Each product has potentially multiple reviews so the connection between the product and reviews is a one to many connection on the index_product to the index_product _review.
