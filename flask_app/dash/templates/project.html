		<h3>The Why</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>We selected this topic because the artificial meat industry is becoming increasingly popular as of late. We find the industry very interesting and want to understand how consumer experience and resulting reviews can predict ratings. After pulling and cleaning our data set from Amazon, we used the Natural Language Processing machine learning model to train a sentiment classifier. During the cleaning process, both five star and one star reviews were maintained, while two, three and four star ratings were removed. Next, we pulled reviews without ratings and directed the machine to predict the ratings based on the analysis of the reviews.</p>

		<h3>Source Data</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>Our data set was pulled from the Amazon Grocery and Gourmet Food section found at the follow link: <a href="http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html">click here for data</a>. We scraped Amazonâ€™s site for our review data as well.</p>

		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>In this project we will use a Natural Language Processing machine learning model to train a sentiment classifier on an Amazon dataset of Grocery and Gourmet Food reviews containing over 1 million reviews.</p>

		<p>The goal of this classifier is to predict user sentiment (positive or negative) for fake meat products. Upon having ratings predicted based on the reviews through NLP, We believe this analysis will help store owners identify which fake meat brands to sell. Having access to a model to predict ratings will allow the stakeholder to understand how reviews affect ratings and, in turn, impact future sales of fake meat products.</p>
