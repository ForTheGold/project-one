This is a great substitute for beef. He loves it and uses it in everything where he used to use ground beef. I don't like the smell of it when I open the package (smells like cat food to me) but it tastes great and is super easy to cook. I literally pull it from the package, squeeze it into four balls, pat them flat, and fry them for very easy burgers (I mean I don't add anything at all - not an egg or anything). I sometimes sprinkle my burger with Worchester sauce for flavor but it's not necessary. Taste exactly like a normal burger.  I've even made shepherds pie with this in place of lamb or beef and it taste great. Warning, these cook on lower heat and for much shorter times than actual ground beef. It can burn easily so wat"

Package, Ground Beef Substitute, 16 Ounce",,10.29,4.6,Christenn Harris,"February 28, 2021",4.0,"I  used beyond beef to make Polish cabbage rolls… This was actually my second attempt cooking with it, the first time I made a vegan meatloaf that was so realistic I couldn’t eat it and threw the whole thing out.Several months later, I tried a second time.I’ve been vegetarian since 2004, but even the visual appearance in the packaging was offputting due to its similarity to real meat. The reddish hued block is flecked through with coconut oil “fat”. When you remove it to a bowl, it feels like ground meat. If cooking on the stove top, it shrinks and changes color as it cooks, with a very realistic texture in mouthfeel. As other reviewers have mentioned, this definitely has an odor when removing from the package, but I did not find it overly offensive.The cabbage roll filling was pleasantly toothsome, and the flavor reminded me of a fast food flame grilled burger.I definitely look forward to trying this in other uses such as meatballs and sliders in the future.As it is still a processed food, this will continue to be an occasional treat. And as one who is soy intolerant, I appreciate the fact this is one of the few soy-free options on the market.Bottom line: if you are looking to reduce your meat intake or a vegan-friendly substitute for ground beef, you might give this"

I prefer the Impossible brand because it doesn't have that smokey flavor but have only had it in sit down restaurants, not in grocery stores.  I just wish that they offered a non-smokey option.

Beyond Meat,"Beyond Meat from PlantBased Frozen oz lb. Package, Ground Beef Substitute, 16 Ounce",,10.29,4.6,ScullyRose,"February 3, 2021",5.0,"When I first got this I was quite hyped seeing the reviews and the packaging thinkng  they may have finally gotten a beef clone. After mildly cooking it I was dissapointed to taste the same taste that I tasted in another protein plant based burger that I had that is quite obviousally different than beef.I put it away and came back to it a few days later in order to fiinish it before it expires. This time I had a different experience. So what if it doesn't taste exactly like beef and you can identify the difference?  That doesn't make it better or worse. Although it has a distinct flavor, it hits the right spots and satisfies any craving youd have for it. Honestly, if all my beef, if I was stll a meat eater was changed to this, I wouldn't even care. This makes me quite optimistic of meat subsitutes which I didn't have in the past. In the past it felt like these meat subsistutes were merely there to help psychologically with the withdrawel symptoms, but honestly this makes me feel like I can have my cake and e"

I can't eat soy protein, so we went with Beyond. The smell was a bit offputting when I opened the package, but I hoped it would dissipate once cooked. The 'meat' browned somewhat, but not like regular ground. The texture was not bad, but the flavor with just salt and pepper was quite strange. My husband and I decided to make a curry with the 'meat' as we thought the strange taste/smell would be taken over by the spices. I was only partially correct. The curry did improve the flavor, but only slightly. With each bite, the strange flavor in my mouth only grew. After 4-5 small bites, I had to stop eating. My husband finished his plate, but struggled to eat his leftovers the next day. I hope in the next few years that meatless 'meat' improves. Until then, I am steering"

I love using this Quorn Meatless Grounds because it holds it shape even when simmered for a long time with chili or spaghetti sauce.  As a meat eater the texture and taste reminds me strongly of ground beef.  Cooking it with some oil of your choice with chopped onions/celerymushrooms, seasoning it with a season salt/parsley, really helps add flavor.  It will scorch if not kept in a sauce because it's not meat and it cooks very quickly.  I really like that it doesn't have that vitamin flavor that some fake meats have.

That source is the soil mold Fusarium venenatum.  It is very unlikely for you to know that you have sensitivity to this novel protein since this is the only product that uses it.If you are sensitive to it then you will find that it causes digestive problems.  In my case I was kept awake all night with diarrhea (I would call it a ""full rinse"").  The next day, at hour 19, I got a debilitating migraine that did not go away until sleep 8 hours later.  Visiting a doctor was considered but ruled out after finding that many people had experienced similar symptoms and most did not have further complications.If you are not sensitive to it then at best you are getting a terribly bland meat imitation product.  Upon initial seasoning I found that it had the taste and texture of shredded cardboard.  As a 12-year vegetarian this was easily remedied and I made it delicious.  It pales in comparison to modern brands like Beyond Meat or Impossible yet is still miles behind something mediocre like Boca.Bottom line: humans have consumed peas, soy, and wheat for thousands of years.

The flavor is pretty good too, if a bit bland. I think it needs a tad more sage.  Sodium is not too high, at 6% of RDA per patty.  But as other reviewers have remarked, the packaging is minimalist and consists of just the box, with no inner  packet, with the patties, each a little bigger than an Oreo cookie, lying flat inside. It is easy for a box with voids or weak corners to get punctured or mangled in transit. I would not eat these sausages if I had shopped online and the box arrived damaged, since it would be impossible to know how, when, and where the damage occurred. These patties should be made a little larger and boxed in a small stack, like a small box of digestive biscuits, as that would eliminate the voids and the flimsy c"

And there is really no way to protest or request a refund unless you open them right away (or you receive a completely open package...which has definitely happened before).  Such bull right?  ...pisses me off just thinking about it.  I honestly think that the packaging is too flimsy so sausages just fall right out in transport.

I love using this Quorn Meatless Grounds because it holds it shape even when simmered for a long time with chili or spaghetti sauce.  As a meat eater the texture and taste reminds me strongly of ground beef.  Cooking it with some oil of your choice with chopped onions/celerymushrooms, seasoning it with a season salt/parsley, really helps add flavor.  It will scorch if not kept in a sauce because it's not meat and it cooks very quickly.  I really like that it doesn't have that vitamin flavor that some fake meats have.

That source is the soil mold Fusarium venenatum.  It is very unlikely for you to know that you have sensitivity to this novel protein since this is the only product that uses it.If you are sensitive to it then you will find that it causes digestive problems.  In my case I was kept awake all night with diarrhea (I would call it a ""full rinse"").  The next day, at hour 19, I got a debilitating migraine that did not go away until sleep 8 hours later.  Visiting a doctor was considered but ruled out after finding that many people had experienced similar symptoms and most did not have further complications.If you are not sensitive to it then at best you are getting a terribly bland meat imitation product.  Upon initial seasoning I found that it had the taste and texture of shredded cardboard.  As a 12-year vegetarian this was easily remedied and I made it delicious.  It pales in comparison to modern brands like Beyond Meat or Impossible yet is still miles behind something mediocre like Boca.Bottom line: humans have consumed peas, soy, and wheat for thousands of years.

   This taste amazing and like real beef if you hook it up right. I mixed half the bag in a nonstick skillet with a 1/3 cup of olive oil ratio. It's dryer than real ground-beef so you need to add fat to give if that beefiness that ground beef has and fry it up a bit on low heat although it's precooked. Then, I added paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, sage, italian seasoning & oregano to make it into ground-sausage.  It Taste similar to Jimmy Dean's ground pork-sausage and had the right texture. I then served it in a Spanish-omelette with swiss cheese & homemade quac to keep the salt/sodium low. I use the other half-bag for homemade Hamburger helper.

Gardein,"Gardein Gluten-Free Ultimate Plant-Based Beefless Ground Crumbles, Vegan, Frozen, 13.7 oz.",,4.79,4.7,Heather B.,"June 11, 2019",5.0,"I bought the Beyond Meat Fiesta crumbles and the Gardein crumbles at the same time so this review is for both and a comparison review. I am trying to eat less meat so I had high hopes for both, particularly Beyond Meat as there is a lot of talk and buzz about this brand. FWIW I had not tried any other products from either company before this.So I paid about $4 for 13.7 ounces of the Gardein crumbles and $5 for 11 ounces of the Beyond Meat crumbles.The consistency of the Beyond crumbles aren’t real crumble but more pre-formed pieces of small meat about the size of a piece of cereal and they don’t really crumble. The Gardein crumbles however do have the consistency of crumbles and do in fact actually crumble when you cook and eat them.So I cooked both to manufacturers specifications in a pan.Now to the taste…..the Beyond crumbles just didn’t feel like I was eating crumbles… the small meat pieces were rubbery and the taste was not very good to be honest. I tried it initially in tacos and didn’t like them. Then I tried it with Mac and cheese thinking it might be better there but in both instances it just sadly wasn’t very good. It kind of reminds of of when they substitute turkey meat instead of beef in that there really wasn’t any taste of fat at all. When I tried it with Mac and Cheese I ended up with a bowl of uneaten crumbles at the end…that should tell you something.The Gardein crumbles on the other hand had the taste and consistency of real beef crumbles. I honestly don’t think I could tell I wasn’t eating meat if I didn’t know it. And the fact that they resemble crumbles in texture and consistency made a big difference IMO. In comparison to Beyond Meat they did have the taste of fat and the chewing them felt like I was eating beef.If I had to give a number grade I would give the Beyond Meat crumbles a 3/10 and the Gardein crumbles a 9/10. When you consider the prices per ounce this is a no brainer IMO (29c for Garden and 46c for"
