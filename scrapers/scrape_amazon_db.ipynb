This time I had a different experience. So what if it doesn't taste exactly like beef and you can identify the difference?  That doesn't make it better or worse. Although it has a distinct flavor, it hits the right spots and satisfies any craving youd have for it. Honestly, if all my beef, if I was stll a meat eater was changed to this, I wouldn't even care.
