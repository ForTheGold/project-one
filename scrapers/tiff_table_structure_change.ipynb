I am trying to eat less meat so I had high hopes for both, particularly Beyond Meat as there is a lot of talk and buzz about this brand. FWIW I had not tried any other products from either company before this.So I paid about $4 for 13.7 ounces of the Gardein crumbles and $5 for 11 ounces of the Beyond Meat crumbles.The consistency of the Beyond crumbles aren’t real crumble but more pre-formed pieces of small meat about the size of a piece of cereal and they don’t really crumble. The Gardein crumbles however do have the consistency of crumbles and do in fact actually crumble when you cook and eat them.So I cooked both to manufacturers specifications in a pan.Now to the taste…..the Beyond crumbles just didn’t feel like I was eating crumbles… the small meat pieces were rubbery and the taste was not very good to be honest. I tried it initially in tacos and didn’t like them. Then I tried it with Mac and cheese thinking it might be better there but in both instances it just sadly wasn’t very good. It kind of reminds of of when they substitute turkey meat instead of beef in that there really wasn’t any taste of fat at all. When I tried it with Mac and Cheese I ended up with a bowl of uneaten crumbles at the end…that should tell you something.The Gardein crumbles on the other hand had the taste and consistency of real beef crumbles. I honestly don’t think I could tell I wasn’t eating meat if I didn’t know it. And the fact that they resemble crumbles in texture and consistency made a big difference IMO. In comparison to Beyond Meat they did have the taste of fat and the chewing them felt like I was eating beef.If I had to give a number grade I would give the Beyond Meat crumbles a 3/10 and the Gardein crumbles a 9/10.

FWIW I had not tried any other products from either company before this.So I paid about $4 for 13.7 ounces of the Gardein crumbles and $5 for 11 ounces of the Beyond Meat crumbles.The consistency of the Beyond crumbles aren’t real crumble but more pre-formed pieces of small meat about the size of a piece of cereal and they don’t really crumble. The Gardein crumbles however do have the consistency of crumbles and do in fact actually crumble when you cook and eat them.So I cooked both to manufacturers specifications in a pan.Now to the taste…..the Beyond crumbles just didn’t feel like I was eating crumbles… the small meat pieces were rubbery and the taste was not very good to be honest. I tried it initially in tacos and didn’t like them. Then I tried it with Mac and cheese thinking it might be better there but in both instances it just sadly wasn’t very good. It kind of reminds of of when they substitute turkey meat instead of beef in that there really wasn’t any taste of fat at all.
